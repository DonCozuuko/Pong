# Pong
My implementation of Pong in C using the Raylib graphics library. Play, or don't. I don't care, theres like a million pong projects out there, what are the chances that somebody looks at this repo, at this README.md. I am the self-aware Pong repository.

## Features
- Theres this little bug where if you get the ball to touch the side of the paddle you can glitch the ball to be *in the paddle*, and can strategically can hold it in that buffer state to launch at your complete will. But you have to genuinely evil person to abuse this cheese bug.

## Quick Start
```
$ ./pong.exe
```

## Build from Source
- External Dependencies:
	- Raylib Graphics Library, but I did the builder the favor of including the main raylib header file and the .a library file in the repo and in the makefile. Your welcome.
- Just make it bro.
```
$ make
```
